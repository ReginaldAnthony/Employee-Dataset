This dataset contains information about employees in a company, including their educational backgrounds, work history, demographics, and employment-related factors. It has been anonymized to protect privacy while still providing valuable insights into the workforce.
The goal of this project is to analyze the employee dataset, this data can provide valuable insights for HR decision-making and workforce optimization.The dataset includes information;


Education: The educational qualifications of employees, including degree, institution, and field of study.

Joining Year: The year each employee joined the company, indicating their length of service.

City: The location or city where each employee is based or works.

Payment Tier: Categorization of employees into different salary tiers.

Age: The age of each employee, providing demographic insights.

Gender: Gender identity of employees, promoting diversity analysis.

Ever Benched: Indicates if an employee has ever been temporarily without assigned work.

Experience in Current Domain: The number of years of experience employees have in their current field.

## Questions for the Analysis (Ask phase)
Research Questions

The project aims to answer several research questions, such as:

* What is the distribution of educational qualifications among employees?
* How does the length of service (Joining Year) vary across different cities?
* What is the gender distribution within the workforce? Assess gender diversity within the company. (Calculate gender ratios, analyze gender-related trends)
* Is there a correlation between Payment Tier and Experience in Current Domain?
* Are there any patterns in leave-taking behavior among employees?

## Preparing the Data (Prepare Phase)
### Data
The dataset is an open dataset source from www.Kaggle.com
#### Importing the dataset
Succesfully downloaded and Imported the dataset to Microsoft excel then prepared to CLEAN and ORGANIZE the data.
## Cleaning the dataset (Process Phase)
* During the data analysis process, no duplicates were identified and removed from the dataset, The dataset consists of 9 columns and 4653 unique rows, ensuring data integrity and accuracy.

## Summarizing the dataset (Analyze Phase)
* Through analysis, the workforce composition within the company reflects a greater prevalence of employees with Bachelor's degrees, while individuals with Ph.D and Masters qualifications are comparatively fewer in number. This observation underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of the company's educational diversity, emphasizing the importance of leveraging the strengths and capabilities of employees across various educational backgrounds to drive organizational success. Moreover, it encourages a holistic approach to talent management and the recognition of the unique contributions that employees from different educational paths can offer to the company's endeavors.


* The visual analysis of Joining Year data across different cities provides a comprehensive understanding of the variation in employees' length of service. By employing effective data visualization techniques, we can discern and illustrate how employees' Joining Year distributions differ among the various cities represented in the dataset.

* The visual representation indicates that the peak year for the length of service across various cities was approximately in 2017, with a notable concentration of employees from the city of New Delhi. This observation, derived from the graphical analysis, underscores a significant cohort of employees joining the organization during that specific timeframe, particularly prevalent in the city of New Delhi. This observation may lead to further exploration of recruitment patterns, retention strategies, and organizational growth during that period.


* There are currently 4653 employees within the dataset (females: 1875 & males: 2778).
* The gender distribution within the company is as follows: there are 2,778 male employees, constituting approximately 59.7% of the total workforce (4,653 employees), and 1,875 female employees, representing approximately 40.3%. This analysis underscores the gender composition within the organization, providing insights that may inform diversity and inclusion initiatives and workforce planning strategies.

* The analysis of leave-taking behavior within the company reveals that out of a total of 4,653 employees, 1,600 employees have taken leave, constituting approximately 34% of the workforce. Concurrently, 3,053 employees, or approximately 66%, have not taken leave during the observed period. This proportional breakdown provides valuable insights into the distribution of leave-taking behavior among employees, which can inform workforce management strategies and initiatives.
